# That's me

I'm RenÃ© ðŸ‘‹, data engineer by day, open-source developer by night (on [GitHub](https://github.com/dehesselle), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dehesselle)).

## Once upon a time

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) was looking for someone to keep the macOS port alive. So I began looking into building and packaging the 1.0 version which was still in development. I wanted to help, put my skills to good use and then see what happens.

## Today

Five years have past since then. A lot has happened: I'm building and packaging several GTK-based applications for macOS now, this kind of work has become my specialty. I've taken on more responsibilities within the Inkscape project and joined their leadership team. I engage with upstream projects, e.g. doing macOS CI work for GNOME, to be as helpful in my area of expertise as I can.
