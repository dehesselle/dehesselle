# That's me

I'm René 👋, platform engineer by day, open-source developer by night (on [GitHub](https://github.com/dehesselle), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dehesselle)).

## Once upon a time

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) was looking for someone to keep the macOS port alive. I decided to pick up the torch and created the build pipeline for what became the 1.0 release eventually. It was a good exercise to hone my skills and a chance to be a part of and to contribute to something bigger than myself. "Give it a couple of months and see what happens" was my take.

## Today

More than seven years have past since then. And a lot has happened: I'm building and packaging several GTK-based applications for macOS now, I am _the_ specialist in this (niche) kind of work. I've taken on more responsibilities within the Inkscape project and joined their leadership team. I've joined the GNOME foundation and maintain their macOS infrastructure, bringing macOS CI to more and more projects.

## Tomorrow

If I could make a wish, I'd quit my day job to work on open-source full time. Or getting hired by someone who sees enough value in my work so I can focus more on it 😉.
