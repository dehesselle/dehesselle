# This is me

## Introduction

Ever since I got my first computer at the age of 13 it became clear to me that from now on "doing something with computers" was going to accompany me for the rest of my life. Consequently, I've turned my hobby into a career, but it's also still my hobby where I can branch out and keep exploring - and that is what you can see me doing here on [GitHub](https://github.com/dehesselle) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dehesselle).

## Career

I've spent most of my career in the field of business intelligence in the insurance sector. My journey began 1999 as software developer learning COBOL on an IBM mainframe and later moving on to becoming a SAS developer and SAS platform administrator for z/OS, Linux and Windows. Most of my professional life with SAS ended in 2019 with the completion of a replatforming project to move SAS off our mainframe to Linux. Today my employer calls me "DevOps engineer" and I'm part of a small agile team that develops and moves services to the cloud (AWS).

## Open source

Being a volunteer developer engaging with various open-source projects is my way of giving back to the community and making an impact with my hobby. My activities revolve around [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) as the biggest project where I maintain the macOS release and also some smaller ones like [Zim](https://zim-wiki.org) (with more to follow). Building and packaging GTK-based apps on macOS is my specialty.

I'd actually love to turn that into my actual career (which open-source developer doesn't!), so... just saying... if you're a company... [I'm here ðŸ“«](mailto:dehesselle@web.de)

### special thanks

Thank you [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) for providing me product subscriptions to support my open-source work.
