## This is me

From COBOL to SAS 9.x, from z/OS to Linux - professionally I'm mostly a developer and administrator for statistics/BI systems. In my spare time I come here (i.e. [GitHub](https://github.com/dehesselle), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dehesselle)) to do something else entirely :)

I also like synthesizers, DAWs, DJing, ... but most of my time I find myself hacking at some project. My open source activities revolve around [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) and building/packaging GTK apps on macOS to a large extent.

Chocolate is ‚ô•Ô∏è.
