# That's me

I'm René 👋, platform engineer by day, open-source developer by night (on [GitHub](https://github.com/dehesselle), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dehesselle)).

## Once upon a time

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) was looking for someone to keep the macOS port alive. I decided to pick up the torch and created the build pipeline for the then not yet relased 1.0. I thought this would be a good execrcise to hone my skills and do something that effects more than just my personal projects. Maybe spend 6 months on it and then see what happens.

## Today

More than six years have past since then. And a lot has happened: I'm building and packaging several GTK-based applications for macOS now, this kind of work has become my specialty. I've taken on more responsibilities within the Inkscape project and joined their leadership team. I've become a GNOME foundation member and maintain their macOS infrastructure, bringing macOS CI to more and more projects.
