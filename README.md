# That's me

I'm RenÃ© ðŸ‘‹, data engineer by day, open-source developer (on [GitHub](https://github.com/dehesselle), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dehesselle)) by night.

## Once upon a time

... I started looking into building and packaging [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) 1.0 for macOS. I wanted to help, put my skills to good use and then see what happens. I initially estimated that this engagement would keep me busy and interested for 6 months, I didn't have any plans beyond that. Which is a good thing, because life happens while you're making plans, and as it turns out, this was the beginning of my open-source career.

## Today

... I'm building and packaging several GTK-based applications for macOS as this has become my specialty. I've taken on more responsibilities within the Inkscape project and joined their leadership committee. And I engage with upstream projects, e.g. doing macOS CI work for GNOME. Still not making plans though, I'm not running out of things to do anytime soon ðŸ˜‰.

### special thanks

Thank you [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) for providing me product subscriptions to support my open-source work.
